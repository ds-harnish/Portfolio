Data scientist with a background in the  Medical Devices Industry. For nearly a decade I worked to design, test and optimize medical devices for communities worldwide. I've spent the past year sifting through the unstructured data to drive business desicions with insights -- and I love it! With my analytical reasoning and communication skills, I am looking for opportunities where I can resolve problems before they develop.
